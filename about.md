* Coder Logue is a blog for developers/students to step more into the coding. We believe that "we can't code unless we     code because Learning how the code works is different from Learning to code". 

* We have taken out this project to help developers/students in their projects by  providing the Code Practices that  may   help them while they are practicing the code. 

* If you have any code snippets share with us by contributing a Guest post.Guest Posts are most welcomed. Pay the          time, contribute your posts by writing to us and helping out in our mission of educating the people to code. 

* Share your code snippets with us and we helps you out in sharing that to the rest of the world.
